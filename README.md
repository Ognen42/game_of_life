- After running main_game.py, **left clicking** anywhere on the grid toggles the status of the cell that is being clicked. 

- Pressing **enter** simulates one step of the simulation.

- Pressing **escape** clears the grid.

- **Left clicking** at any point during the simulation allows you to start toggling cells again by further clicks.
